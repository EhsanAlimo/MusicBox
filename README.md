# Music Box

## The Music Box was my first Full-stack project

This web app is built using Ruby version 2.7.4 and Rails version 5.2.6 and Spotify API.
In terms of styling I write all the CSS to make a practice and get more familiar with CSS.

## Description

It contains of three main models which are Users, Playlists and Songs.

## Executing

1. To visit the web app please click the [link](https://guarded-dusk-14110.herokuapp.com/)
2. To access the main contain you need to sign up or login.

## Approach

There is an admin authentication so that the user can add, edit and delete songs and playlists.

Admin have access to the all users that have signed up to the app and also deleting a existing song.

Users authentication and security with both front end and back end

A simple search button function for songs base on the song's name.

A user can add songs and also create many playlist.

Through the playlist a user can add many songs to the playlist and also from a song view a user can add a specific song to a playlist that he/she create.

A user can add pictures to playlists and name them differently

## Future Continuous Improvement

- Using more sophisticated API for my web ap
- Adding some libraries to style it better
